    <h1>Basic document flow</h1>

    <p>
        I am a basic block level element. My adjacent block level elements sit on new
        lines below me.
    </p>

    <p>
        By default we span 100% of the width of our parent element, and we are as tall
        as our child content. Our total width and height is our content + padding +
        border width/height.
    </p>

    <p>
        We are separated by our margins. 
    </p>

    <p>
        Inline elements <span>like this one</span> and <span>this one</span> sit on
        the same line along with adjacent text nodes, if there is space on the same
        line. Overflowing inline elements will
        <span>wrap onto a new line if possible (like this one containing text)</span>,
        or just go on to a new line if not, much like this image will do:
