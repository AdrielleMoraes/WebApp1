            <h1>Power-Up Mushroom</h1>
            <p>A Power-Up Mushroom, is a red mushroom with white spots that causes Small Mario to turn into his Super
                form, allowing him to smash through bricks and take an extra hit from enemies.
                Power-Up mushrooms were inspired by the concept of mushrooms being associated with magical worlds in
                general, like the wonderland of Alice's Adventures in Wonderland and the Mushroom Kingdom.
                Regardless, the item has become one of the most iconic items in video game history, and it is almost as
                known as Mario himself.
            </p>
            <p>
                The manual of the original Super Mario Bros. actually refers to the Super Mushroom as the "Magic Mushroom," but the name was changed due to the unintentional reference to hallucinogenic mushrooms.
                 The original Japanese manual referred to them as Super Mushrooms, and the English name was reverted to its original Japanese name in future games.

                <p>Coins are found commonly throughout the Mushroom Kingdom, being the type of currency used there.
                    Despite this, Coins are not used as currency in several of their appearances, mainly the
                    platformers, in which collecting 100 Coins instead rewards a 1-Up.

                    Other protagonists, including Toad, Luigi, Princess Peach, and Rosalina, can also obtain a Fire

                <p>In Super Mario World, Cape Feathers first appear in Donut Plains 1. When Mario (or Luigi) grabs one, it turns him into Caped Mario (or Caped Luigi).
                     As Caped Mario, the player can glide through the air, similar to the Super Leaf's effect in Super Mario Bros. 3. </p>
